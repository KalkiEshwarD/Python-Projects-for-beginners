# Python-Projects-for-beginners
Few Python projects that beginners could give a go. I would suggest you first give a go and then look into the contents of the file.
In each file I will be explaining as much as I could to give a better understaning of the code in the project.
I have just finished Learn Python The Hard Way.
I am entirely new to the world of coding. Any knowledge I have learnt is either from that book or from the internet. 
The code you will find below would most surely not be the best but it works. Well if (hopefully you do) you find improvements, try to send it over. I'll be happy to go through it.
